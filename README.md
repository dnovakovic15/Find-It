# Find_It

Find_It is a web application that uses Google Maps API to provide the user locations and directions. This web application not only provides you directions, but it also provides you with the latest tweets about their destination. On top of that, you can provide a time range for your departure time and we will show you the most optimal time to leave based on traffic patterns. 

# Prerequisites

Please use a Google Chrome Web browser as Firefox has trouble communicating with Google Maps API in order to provide your current location.
